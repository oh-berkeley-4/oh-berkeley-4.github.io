	Hi!  Welcome to style.css.  CSS stands for cascading style sheet - we recommend http://www.w3schools.com/css/ for the nitty gritty of CSS syntax.  But basically, what you should know is:

	 - Which part of a web page the css is referring to is specified by either ids or classes in the .html file.  For instance, a div with id="signup" will be styled by the element #signup below.  # means ID, and . means class in .css files.

	 - Elements inside of other elements inherit their style, unless the .css file specifies otherwise.  For instance, if you have the html: <div id="outside">Hello <div id="inside">world!</div></div>, and 'Hello' is specified in css (#outside) as being in bold font, 'world!' will also be bold unless you add a #inside element to your css.

 	-  Fun style elements to play with that won't mess with the structure of the page include color, font, and background.  When playing with colors, you can consult http://hexcolor.com/.  Colors can be specified by name ("black", "white") or hexadecimal notation (#000000, #FFFFFF).
